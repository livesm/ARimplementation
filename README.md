# AR Experience Unity Project
This repository contains a Unity project developed as part of a master's thesis, focusing on the implementation of an Augmented Reality (AR) experience. Detailed descriptions of the development process, design intentions, and implemented features, are discussed in the thesis.

In this repository, you'll find specific requirements and notes related to the project's development. Additionally, links to assets, sound effects, and any graphics used in the final implementation of the AR experience are provided for reference.

## Requirements
+ Unity 2022.3.1+
+ iOS 12.0+ 
+ ARKit support (iOS device supporting ARKit, Target Device: iPhone Only)
+ XCode 15.4+

Note: To access and display current weather conditions, an API key is required. Please note that this API key will be deactivated after the project to prevent any unnecessary costs. Any api key accessing current weather conditions can replace the current. A free api from "openweathermap.org" has been used in this project (https://openweathermap.org). Declaration of key can be found and altered in /Scripts/WeatherManager.cs/. The script calls for current weather conditions of Trondheim, Norway, and this can be altered in the same script based on location.

Further, the implemented flower-wall is locationbased in the sense that the green-wall acts as an AR-marker and activates the blooming of the flowers.
